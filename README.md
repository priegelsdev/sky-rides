# Sky Rides
### Fly high, ride easy

## Purpose
This project is built to mimic a fully fleshed out website for a fictitious flying car rental service. It allows for login of the user (or host) to see a dashboard with income and reviews for the rented out rides.
For this purpose the website is using a fake backend server to practice pulling data from an external source and to be able to simulate a login process.

The pictures used were generated by an AI image generator fed with creative prompts to get relatively realistic pictures. 

## Key Features
- Fake server storing data that is being fetched
- Navigation fully functionable
- History stack adjusted for logged in users
- Rendered error component on non existing pages
- Error displayed on wrong log-ins or accessing Host route without being logged in
- Layout components used to only partially render pages and improve loading speed
